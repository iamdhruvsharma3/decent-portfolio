# 🔒 Security Setup Guide

## ⚠️ UPDATED: Professional Admin Login System

Your portfolio now has a **complete admin authentication system** with a dedicated login page. Here's what was implemented and what you need to do:

## 🛡️ What's Been Secured

1. **Protected Routes**: All `/dashboard/*` and `/admin/*` routes now require authentication
2. **Professional Login Page**: Beautiful themed login at `/admin/login`
3. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic logout
4. **Guestbook Protection**: Admin guestbook panel now requires authentication
5. **Middleware Protection**: Server-side authentication middleware

## 🚨 REQUIRED: Set Your Admin Credentials

### Step 1: Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Admin Authentication - CHANGE THESE IMMEDIATELY!
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

### Step 2: Choose Strong Credentials

- **Username**: Choose something other than "admin"
- **Password**: Use a strong password with:
  - At least 12 characters
  - Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
  - Not easily guessable

**Example:**

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=portfolio_admin_2024
ADMIN_PASSWORD=MyStr0ng!P@ssw0rd#2024
```

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Public Access**: Anyone can view your portfolio pages
2. **Admin Access**: Only authenticated users can access CMS
3. **Login Flow**:
   - Click "🔒 Admin: Go to Studio" button
   - Enter username/password in modal
   - Get redirected to Sanity Studio

## 🧪 Testing Security

### Test 1: Unauthorized Access

1. Open incognito/private browser window
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
3. Should see authentication prompt
4. Cancel or enter wrong credentials
5. Should be blocked

### Test 2: Authorized Access

1. Click any "🔒 Admin: Go to Studio" button
2. Enter correct credentials
3. Should access Sanity Studio successfully

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### For Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME` = your chosen username
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` = your secure password

### For Other Platforms:

Set the environment variables in your hosting platform's configuration.

## 🔄 Updating Credentials

To change admin credentials:

1. Update `.env.local` (development)
2. Update environment variables in production
3. Restart your application

## ⚡ Quick Security Checklist

- [ ] Set strong `ADMIN_USERNAME` (not "admin")
- [ ] Set strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- [ ] Test unauthorized access is blocked
- [ ] Test authorized access works
- [ ] Update production environment variables
- [ ] Remove any public CMS links from navigation

## 🚨 Security Notes

- **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
- **Change default credentials** immediately
- **Use HTTPS** in production
- **Consider 2FA** for additional security (future enhancement)
- **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication Required" in Development

- Check `.env.local` has correct variables
- Restart development server: `npm run dev`

### Can't Access Studio

- Verify credentials are correct
- Check browser console for errors
- Try clearing browser cache

### Production Issues

- Verify environment variables are set
- Check hosting platform logs
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled
